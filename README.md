# IPL Match Win Probability Predictor Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the win probability of IPL matches using various machine learning algorithms. The implementation includes a Jupyter notebook (`ipl-win-probability-predictor.ipynb`) that covers the entire process from data exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Project Files

1. **ipl-win-probability-predictor.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter notebook contains the main code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and win probability prediction.

2. **deliveries.csv**
   - The dataset containing detailed information about each delivery in IPL matches.

3. **matches.csv**
   - The dataset containing information about IPL matches.

4. **pipe.pkl**
   - The serialized pipeline object containing the trained model for win probability prediction.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Install necessary libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Sujoychandradas/IPL-Match-Win-Probability-Predictor-using-ML.git
      cd IPL-Match-Win-Probability-Predictor-using-ML


2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
     jupyter notebook "ipl-win-probability-predictor.ipynb"

3. Execute each cell in the notebook to explore, preprocess, train the model, and make predictions.

### Customization and Experimentation
Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak hyperparameters, or explore other machine-learning algorithms to improve the model's performance.
